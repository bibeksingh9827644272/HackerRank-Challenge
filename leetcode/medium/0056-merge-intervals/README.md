# Merge Intervals

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return  *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

    def merge(self, intervals):
        intervals.sort()
        result = []

        for start, end in intervals:
            if result and start <= result[-1][1]:
                result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], end)
            else:
                result.append([start, end])

        return result
```
