# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list,  *delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once*. Return  *the linked list  **sorted**  as well*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

# Definition for singly-linked list.

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        current = head

        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next

        return head
        
```
